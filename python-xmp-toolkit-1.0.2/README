Python XMP Toolkit is a library for working with XMP metadata, as well as
reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats. 

Python XMP Toolkit is wrapping Exempi (using ctypes), a C/C++ XMP library
based on Adobe XMP Toolkit, ensuring that future updates to the XMP standard
are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum amount of work.

Python XMP Toolkit has been developed by: 
 * ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency 
 * ESO - European Southern Observatory
 * CRS4 - Centre for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia

Additional documentation is included in the docs/ directory in both HTML and
PDF versions.
